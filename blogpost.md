## Code formatting: Black and Flake8 and precommit hooks



Working reproducibly means having to use commonly accepted code practices.I have been talking in previous blog posts 
about the need for a process that ensures that code that is tested. Today I will talk about the need
to also have codebases that are ... readable. Because its not enough for the code to compile! 

Robert Martin on his book 'Clean Code' mentions that “the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. 
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to 
read makes it easier to write.” 

There is very good guidance for writting Python code. It is called [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and its 
*the official*  Style Guide for Python Code. Its very easy to make your IDE give warnings if you have violated one of the many style rules.

Personally when I do that, I get at least 10-20 such warnings on my first try on something :P. . 
Just having the warnings of course is half the work. Correcting the code so it passes the warnings is the other half.
And its kind of boring to be frank. Thankfully there are tools to help with that!

Here is where  [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black) comes into the picture

Black formats my code, makes it readable so I dont have to do it all myself.I just need to install it from a bash terminal

```bash
pip install black
```

There is a [black Playground](https://black.now.sh/?version=stable&state=_Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L-Wj4ARIAmpdAD2IimZxl1N_WlkPinBFoXIfdFTaTVkGVeHShArYj9yPlDvwBA7LhGo8BvRQqDilPtgsfdKl-ha7EFp0Ma6lY_06IceKiVsJ3BpoICJM9wU1VJLD7l3qd5xTmo78LqThf9uibGWcWCD16LBOn0JK8rhhx_Gf2ClySDJtvm7zQJ1Z-Ipmv9D7I_zhjztfi2UTVsJp7917XToHBm2EoNZqyE8homtGskFIiif5EZthHQvvOj8S2gJx8_t_UpWp1ScpIsD_Xq83LX-B956I_EBIeNoGwZZPFC5zAIoMeiaC1jU-sdOHVucLJM_x-jkzMvK8Utdfvp9MMvKyTfb_BZoe0-FAc2ZVlXEpwYgJVAGdCXv3lQT4bpTXyBwDrDVrUeJEg5cXH4TUTNf-yo029ofjTcZgdwbwkBGElHbHHsQNOhuA4R9GbE2Xx6TfVmH9I4AsqU3ohV7t3GkBwkM8XInLiVOQZ4p5yjM-SW4u3I6_BUS8o2djSZaPvzZPDScXVk1OXu3w0wV7DfrgiK_dpzHntoOvqSHrNLg-Ea6zvV6G2nil3QBTBPl5PDtMwDKchtvwmlhnbvTOrh53X9EnSe8QtRKbMLO4pxx4bAJX-hVCXl5OHpCGZLowD7JdKj1-NctJy9DL99yr-X6yu7KwGCYG7t3fm-lt7Lg_HS9xbBrWDVKBKwM2F7hmR1_n9RFjznRBHD3OpHKlgiWjbWJI0Q6GhXazSt_NVH1KtFiY_UPzzuchkeq2AcjGvQd3-ZPkoFJkNU1Xx7q1i62bM0OKwmDiCfvkAawxnd7m-XNxYKWe-wOQsezLPJVoqGQVoAAAAMKfaCNgGGWKAAGGBckIAABcXArGscRn-wIAAAAABFla)
where you can copy and paste some Python and see how it would look formatted by black.Have a look!

As a simple example I have some code that has some style issues. One line has way too much code.
Some others have weird spacing. Nothing is failing but its not very readable.BTW this is just some code using
the great [ciw](https://github.com/CiwPython/Ciw) package.

![ciw app](https://github.com/mamonu/mamonu.github.io/raw/master/assets/cmft/ciw-preblack.png)

I want to use it once so I just point it to my directory where my code is

```bash
black [nameofmycodedir]/
```

The result looks much better 


![ciw after black](https://github.com/mamonu/mamonu.github.io/raw/master/assets/cmft/after-black.png)


However I want to automate this process as much as possible. 


In order to do this I will use the [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) framework for creating some git hook scripts.


The maintainers describe git hook scripts as 'useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. 
Running pre-commit hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, 
,allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks'.
Even if someone doesnt develop code that is under a code review process , automatic code style enforcement is still 
useful for the 'future-self' :) .


In order to get this process automated I will need to do the following things:

#### step 1: install pre-commit by entering the following on a bash terminal prompt:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

#### step 2: add the following code on a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` on the folder my code is:


```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: stable
    hooks:
    - id: black
      language_version: python3.7
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks:
    - id: flake8
```

#### step 3: run the following on a bash terminal on the code directory.This installs the hooks above to the .git/ directory

```bash
pre-commit install
```

#### step 4 : add `pyproject.toml` on the code directory which has the following:


```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.hg
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | _build
  | buck-out
  | build
  | dist
)/
'''
```

You can add anything you DONT want black to change on the exclude part.
Note that the max-line-length is set to 79.Black has something like 88 as default but I have changed it to 79 so
as to not have issues with flake8. 


#### step 5: add `.flake8` file on the code directory :

flake8 performs a final check for compliance to PEP8. Since the code has been through black there should not be any suprises.
If you want some of the rules ignored then you can find all PEP8 rules [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/#finished-peps-done-with-a-stable-interface)
Add the ones you dont want on the ignore line on the `.flake8` file below:

```flake8
[flake8]
ignore = E203, E266, E501, W503, F403, F401
max-line-length = 79
select = B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9
```


Note that the max-line-length is 79 on flake8.

#### step 6: now use git with our added pre-commit hooks  :

I assume there has been a 'git init' statement and some added code already. If not do that first!Then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "my first pre-commit hook commit"
```

The result should be something like below:
black fails and then changes your code

![hooks after black](https://github.com/mamonu/mamonu.github.io/raw/master/assets/cmft/commithook2.png)

lets try once more.


```bash
git add .
git commit -m "this time for sure! "
git push
```
If everything passes (and assuming you have setup your remote repo address), the commit is made. 
If not, perform necessary edits and then commit again.
